## Project Overview

  
The projects in Vector are divided into 3 categories based on their complexity - 
1. `src/beginner` -
   - Entry Level Projects meant for people just starting out with Agents.
   - All agents are under 100 lines of code.
   - Single Agent Single Tool Systems

2. `src/intermediate` -
   - These projects are aimed at people well versed with basics for AI Agents.
   - Multi Agent Multi Tool projects.
  
3. `src/advanced` -
   - End to End projects utilizing multiple concepts within AI Agents.
   - Takes care of best practices and aimed at building products.
  

## Project Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a package manager for fast, reliable dependency management.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (for installing uv)

### Setup Steps

1. **Install `uv`**  
   Follow instructions at the [installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) page or run:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishandutta0098/vector-ai-agents-lab.git
   cd vector-ai-agents-lab
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   This command:
   - Creates a virtual environment in `.venv/`
   - Installs all required packages from `pyproject.toml`
   - Locks dependencies for reproducible builds

4. **Run a script**  
   ```bash
   uv run src/beginner/pdf_summarizer.py
   ```

## Usage

### Running Scripts
Use `uv run` to execute any Python script in the project:
```bash
uv run <path-to-script>.py
```

The `uv run` command automatically:
- Uses the project's virtual environment
- Ensures all dependencies are available
- Handles Python version compatibility

### Adding Dependencies
```bash
uv add <package-name>
```

### Removing Dependencies
```bash
uv remove <package-name>
```

## Notes

- Dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`
- The virtual environment is created in `.venv/` (git-ignored)
- `uv.lock` ensures reproducible installations across different machines
- No need to manually activate the virtual environment when using `uv run`

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Import errors when running scripts  
**Solution**: Make sure you've run `uv sync` to install all dependencies

**Issue**: Python version mismatch  
**Solution**: Ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed: `python --version`

**Issue**: `uv` command not found  
**Solution**: Reinstall uv with `pip install uv` and ensure pip's bin directory is in your PATH
